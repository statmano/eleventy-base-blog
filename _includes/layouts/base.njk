		<h1>SEAN OF ALL TRADES</h1>
			<p>Welcome to my blog!

This is a smattering of some of the thoughts that happen to go on in my head crossed with a little dash of humor along the way. Hopefully you'll find some enjoyment reading these- maybe some will personally resonate with you, maybe some will make you laugh, maybe some will spark an interest on some of the wide range of interests I'll talk about... or maybe you just want to harshly judge me and critique everything with a fine-tooth comb (or is it fine-toothed?). 

Anyways, I'm looking to get these out _at least_ twice a month, maybe more if the mood hits me. You can keep up with all of them by bookmarking this site (yea that's still a thing!), following me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/theseanobrien.com), or via this RSS Feed (when it's up).</p>
